# Integrating VeilCore

For developers building software that laboratories, breeders, registries or rights bodies
use. If you are looking for the format itself, read [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

## What this is, and what it is not

**This is not a service you sign up for.** There is no account, no API key, and no server
you have to reach. Your software computes a commitment locally and that is the whole
dependency.

**Your system stays your system.** Your identifiers, your database, your workflow. A
commitment is one field added to a record you already create.

**Nothing sensitive leaves your infrastructure.** Sample descriptions, laboratory reports,
client data, genetics: none of it is transmitted. What gets published is a 32-byte hash
that reveals nothing about its contents.

## Why anyone would bother

Your users have records. Their records are their own word, which is the weakest evidence
there is in a dispute — produced by the party relying on them, and creatable after the
fact.

Adding a commitment turns a record into something a stranger can check: the description
existed on a given date and has not been altered since. That does not make it true. It
makes it fixed, which is the thing a court, a customs officer, or a buyer can work with.

## The smallest useful integration

```
npm install veilcore-records
```

```js
import { computeCommitment, newNonce } from 'veilcore-records';

const record = {
  formatVersion: '0.1',
  recordId: yourOwnIdentifier,
  subjectType: 'plant-genetic-material',
  profile: 'veilcore/profile/cannabis/v0.1',
  commitmentAlgorithm: 'sha256/canonical-json/v1',
  anchor: { chain: 'midnight', network: 'undeployed' },
  sealedAt: new Date().toISOString().replace(/\.\d{3}Z$/, 'Z'),
  holder: { id: yourClientIdentifier },
  profileData: { ...yourExistingFields, nonce: newNonce() },
};

record.commitment = await computeCommitment(record);
// Store record.commitment alongside the record in your own database.
```

That is a working integration. Everything below makes it more useful.

## The four things worth adding, in order

**1. Store the nonce.** It is part of what the commitment covers. A record whose nonce is
lost can never be verified again, by anyone, including you. This is the single most
common way to get this wrong.

**2. Sign what you attest to.** If your users issue reports about someone else's material,
sign them. An unsigned attestation is a claim your system recorded; a signed one is a
statement your user made. The difference matters in exactly the situations this exists for.

**3. Batch before anchoring.** Anchoring commitments individually is expensive and requires
each user to hold a wallet. Aggregate a day's records into a Merkle tree, publish one root,
and give each user their inclusion proof. One transaction, any number of records, and your
users never touch a ledger.

**4. Hand users their proof.** A proof is a small JSON file: the commitment, the path to the
root, and the transaction that published it. It verifies with this package and a chain
lookup, with no dependency on you or on us. That independence is the point — a record that
stops being verifiable when a company disappears is not evidence.

## What you must not do

**Do not compute commitments on a server on your users' behalf** unless they understand
that. A commitment computed by someone else is that party's claim about a record, not the
holder's own. Where your users need to make a statement that is theirs, the computation
belongs on their machine.

**Do not let anyone set a correction's severity.** The format classifies severity from
which field changed, precisely because a party choosing their own would always choose the
harmless option.

**Do not report an unanchored record as anchored,** or an unsigned attestation as signed.
The format distinguishes them so that the difference reaches whoever is relying on it.

## Verifying without integrating

If you only need to check records other people produced, this is the whole of it:

```js
import { verifyCommitment } from 'veilcore-records';
const result = await verifyCommitment(record);
```

No account, no key, no network. This will always be free.

## Confirming your implementation is correct

If you implement the format yourself rather than using this package — in another language,
or inside an existing system — the conformance vectors tell you whether you got it right:

    node conformance/run-cli.mjs "your-command"

Your program reads a job on standard input and writes a result on standard output. There
are thirteen vectors. Three independent implementations pass them: TypeScript, Python and
Rust, each written from the specification rather than from each other.

## A complete example

`examples/lab-integration.mjs` walks through a laboratory receiving a sample, signing the
report it produced, anchoring a day's records in one transaction, and what the client can
prove years later. It runs with no accounts and no configuration:

    node examples/lab-integration.mjs

## Questions and corrections

The specification is published for comment, and specific correction is more useful than
general agreement. Open an issue, or write to hunterfrancisroberts@gmail.com.
